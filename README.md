## Custumized Gatsby Starter

```shell
# create a new Gatsby site using the aksite starter
gatsby new my-site https://github.com/atarukodaka/gatsby-aksite-starter
```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
